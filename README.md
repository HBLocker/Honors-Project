# Deep-Phishing-Comparing-Deep-Learning-phishing emails
Hons project deep learnring at detectinh pgishing emails based form plain text CNN,BLSTM, BiCnn and a LSTM
A Grade dissertation! 
Hons project 
run in google colab on GPU saves you time 
was comparing ifferent deep learnring models for phishing email detection 

next stage would be to have a server running then the model classify each email
BERT would be cool also or some web server to do the work and release a full project 
model was easy to build just rest of the stack needs adding 

web filter

split email up (strip of characters)

send text to classify function 

send to client if it is a phish and indicate why 


---> email ---> Deep Phish --> user
