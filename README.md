# Deep-Phishing-Comparing-Deep-Learning-phishing emails
Hons project deep learnring at detecting pgishing emails based form plain text CNN,BLSTM, BiCnn and a LSTM.


1:1 grade for dissertation. 

To run :Google colab then select GPU 


next stage would be to have a server running then the model classify each email
BERT would be cool also or some web server to do the work and release a full project 
model was easy to build just rest of the stack needs adding. 
maybe the use of flask might be good for making this into a kind of real application, then the use of the BI-CNN model as the classifier. 

#TODO:
1 server to get email:
2 strips of non UTF-8 characters and special characters. 
3 Passed to web filter 
4 results come back for classficaiton 
5 sends back to user. 




---> email ---> Deep Phish --> user
