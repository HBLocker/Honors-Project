# Deep-Phishing-Comparing-Deep-Learning-Models-at-Detecting-Phishing-Emails-from-Their-Plain-Text-Pro
Hons project deep learnring at detectinh pgishing emails based form plain text CNN,BLSTM, BiCnn and a LSTM

Hons project 
run in google colab on GPU saves you time 
was comparing ifferent deep learnring models for phishing email detection 
next stage would be to have a server running then the model classify each emai

---> email ---> Deep Phish --> user
